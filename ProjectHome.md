Welcome!!!!... To the Replacement / Alternative Windows Application for the cool USB Salter MiBody Scales. The original software can be found at www.mibody.co.uk.

This version of the software requires the Microsoft .NET Framework to run which means it could also be made to run on linux operating systems using mono.

At the moment I plan to work on this application weekly in my spare time but ive added this as a open google project so that anyone who feels like can contribute to the project.

I already have a proof of concept application available to download which can read in the BODYDATA.TXT file and display the user data in a nice-looking, sortable grid.

Firstly some things to know about the Salter MiBody Software.

Firstly, the MiBody software deletes the contents of the BODYDATA.TXT file once it has read in the data. This is silly I know but it means that the if you want to import your readings into this application you must do it before entering it into the official MiBody software.

Secondly, the readings BMR, BMI **Body Water percentage are not saved onto the USB pen when transferring your readings!!! - These are instead calculated by the MiBody windows software. This means that I have had to find the formulas for these. BMR & BMI are very well documented on the net and have been done. However I do not know what the formula for Body Water % is so this is still outstanding. This is the only reading that I have not been able to display.**

This project is completly open source so if anyone wants to contribute then please do not hesitate to 'chip' in. There are lots of neat things that could be done with this application using better graphs, statistics, exporting to excel, etc, etc, etc.

Enjoy!
